# Biofluids-Research-Lab-Control-Center-Lehigh-University
MATLAB scripts written to perform Biofluids Research Lab (Lehigh University) Activities. 
The stand-alone and plotting scripts are short scripts that perform short analysis or data acquisition for quick testing of hardware. 
The MasterControlGUI (m-file and GUI) together comprise of a GUI based control environment that I created to calibrate sensors, 
perform data acquisition, post-process signals and finally generate graphical results. 
This repository is maintained to help all incoming members of Biofluids lab in understanding the current (August 2016) code and 
develop and modify it for future purposes. 
I have immensely enjoyed my 3 years of designing, and building test equipment as well as running aerodynamics tests in this research lab, 
and I hope future members of this lab do too.
